How to redirect to /progress after login
todo----------------------------

allow users to save custom premade workouts which will be used as a template to easily insert data

auto complete new insertion of premade workout to the data of the last time they inserted workout type
so it's one click if same workout was performed but no progress

create schedules
phantom suggest auto completed template based on day 

ui shit: have date insert hidden, default to now but allow user to change only to previous day 
if previous day in db, update not insert
?Postgress function for same day since data IS timestamp not just date?

create goals
